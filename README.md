# pong-rs

To make the base of this game I followed this [Tutorial](https://tetra.seventeencups.net/tutorial/)

I added some things like menus, a point system, different sprites, and audio. 

You could also use this as an example for how to do some of those things. Disclaimer: I don't use the most efficient or conventional methods as I am just beginning learning to make games in Rust.

**Installation**

You need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. Instructions for installing Rust and Cargo are on the [Rust Website](https://www.rust-lang.org/) You may also need to install the [SDL2 dev tools](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) if they are not already installed on your machine.

Anyways, here is how you install it from the command line:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/talonbragg/pong-rs.git
$ cd pong-rs
$ cargo run
```

This should get the game up and running!

**Building Executable**

If you want to build the executable, here is how you do it:

```
$ cd pong-rs
$ cargo build --release
```

Please report any issues with installing the game on the issues section of the repository.
